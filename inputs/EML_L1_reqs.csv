EML-1,Planet Mass Function,"WFIRST shall measure the mass function of exoplanets with masses > 1 	MEarth and orbital semi-major axes >=1 AU to better than 10% (TBV) per decade in mass.",,,,,,1
EML-2,Mars Frequency,"WFIRST shall measure the frequency of Mars-mass objects to 20% (TBV).",,,,,,2
EML-3,Planet Masses,"WFIRST shall determine the masses of, and distances to, host stars of 50% (TBV) of the detected planets with a precision of 20% (TBV).",,,,,,3
EML-4,Free-floating Planets,"WFIRST shall measure the frequency of free floating planetary-mass objects in the Galaxy from Mars to 10 Jupiter masses in mass. If there is one MEarth free-floating planet per star, measure this frequency to ~20% (TBV).",,,,,,4
